I am a graduate student in a poor area of China. My major is plant pathology. <!-- more -->I don't have a bioinformatics-related course at my university. I don't have access to good educational resources. I hope to apply for a scholarship to complete this course and complete my studies and wishes.

First of all, I am very interested in bioinformatics. I like programming and biology. Secondly, my research needs to use bioinformatics. I want to use this course to consolidate my foundation. Use what I have learned to contribute to my research.

After the study is completed, I will share the knowledge I have learned with my colleagues in the lab and solve the bioinformatics problems in our lab.

Coursera has created a barrier-free university that brings convenience to many students who are unable to afford it. Here, thanks to Coursera and the various agencies, thank them for their selfless and great dedication.

 

 

Dear reviewer, I am a student from Yunnan Agricultural University. My major is plant pathology. I would very much like to be able to apply for a scholarship for this course. After completing this course, I will gain a lot.

First of all, I can successfully complete my postgraduate studies and further pursue a higher degree. Having a high degree of education is very important to me and is very important to my family. I will work hard to get the chance.

Secondly, after completing this course, in addition to being able to solve my own problems, I can help solve the problems in the laboratory. Our lab has many second- and third-generation sequencing data, and more things are waiting to be mined.

Learning this course is very important for the development of my thinking and hands-on ability. It is also important to my future at the same time.

Thank you!
